# laso
A library for large-scale optimization

## user guide
A guide to using laso can be found in appendix A (pg 108) [here](http://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/5583/).

## algorithm
A description of the laso algorithm and a summary of its performance on test problems from the literature can be found in chapter 4 (pg 46) [here](http://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/5583/).

The bulk of the laso algorithm is implemented in [SolverAL.cpp](https://github.com/nicholsonjohnc/laso/blob/master/LASO/SolverAL.cpp) and [RecursionLBFGS.cpp](https://github.com/nicholsonjohnc/laso/blob/master/LASO/RecursionLBFGS.cpp).
